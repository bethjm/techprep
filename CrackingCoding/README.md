## Behavioral interview...

start with an interesting and clickbatey nugget when starting a story

## Big O

<h1> Anaology for run time </h1>
Imagine that you have a file that you need to get to someone who lives across the country

You could email it or send it via postal service on a usb

depending on the size of the file one option may be more time and/or cost effieicent than the other

you have to decide based on the size of the file what the most appropriate delivery route would be

<h1>Time compexity </h1>

Electronic transfer would be 0(s) with s being the size of the file. This means that the time to transfer the file increase with the size of the file

Airplane transfer would be 0(1) with repsect to the size of the file. As the size of the file increases it wont take any longer to get the file to your friend. The time is constant

No matter how biug the constant is and how slow the linear increase is, linear will at some point surpass the constant

You can have multiple variables in your runtime. Example: painting a fence would be w (width) meters wide and h (height) meters high. which would be described as 0(wh). if you needed p layers on paint you could say it was 0(whp)

<h1>Space complexity</h1>
Space complexity is the amount of memory that an algorithm takes up

If we need to create an array of size n, this will require 0(n) space. if we need a two dimensional array of size n by n, this will require 0(n^2) space
