today...

I got the workout app to a point where I can stop for now, putting that project on the back burner until I finish steohs website.

I worked on steph homepage mock up and got approval for the design. Will start desinging the homepage. Photos in steph massage repo.

I decided Neetcode isnt working for me int eh way that I want it to. I found another way to guide my tech prep. I am goign to try using this approach-
Arrays
Linked lists
Hash maps
Queues
Stacks
Trees
Graphs

Breadth first search
Depth first search
Recursion

——

Start with easy questions

——

If you can’t solve a question within the first 30 minutes…

give up
look at the solution
understand the logic behind the solution
Try to implement the logic in coding yourself
If after 30 minutes you can’t get the code, then look at the code solution and understand why the code was written that way

——

Goal is to be able to solve the question within 20 minutes

——

Follow really strict schedule

2-3 questions per day
