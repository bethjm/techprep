# Today I am focusing on learning how to think about solving techincal interview questions
# I watched this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OamzN90kPg

#problem to solve: contains duplicate
#given an integer array nums, reutn true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct

#things I am understanding:
#1. "brute forcing it" is less effective
#2. sorting the array is more effective than brute force checking it is more effective, but takes up memory space


#things I am struggling to understand:
#1. what the time space measurements actually mean
# solution- I will put the measurements on flascards and memorize what they are so I am more familiar with them
#2. Python syntax
# solution- keep learning
#3. How to do this in JavaScript
# solution- don't worry about that right now
