Today I am focusing on:
</br>

<ul>
<li>
finishing up valid anagram 
<ul>
<li>
DONE
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
better understanding time/space complexity
<ul>
<li>
made flash cards based on bro code data structures and algorithms video
</li>
<li>
studied flash cards and memorized:
linear time is 0(n),
factoral time is 0(n!),
constant time is 0(1),
logarithmic time is 0(log n),
quasilinear is 0(n log n),
quadratic is 0(n^2)
</li>
<li>
studied flash cards an memorized:
</br>
0(1)- as data increases the time to process stays the same, 0(n!)- extremely slow, O(n^2)- as data increase time to process significantly increases, 0(log n)- as data increases the algorithm becomes more efficient, n- the amount of data, 0(n)- as the data increases time increases, 0(n log n)- as data increases time to process increases
</li>
<li>
studied flashcards and memorized: 0(n)- looping through and array, searching through a linked list, 0(1)- random access in an array, adding  to the beggining of a linked list, 0(log n)- binary search
</br>
NOTE: need to memorize 0(n log n) and 0(n^2)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
completing a section of udemy course
</li>
<li>
attempting another neetcode question
</li>
</ul>
