-brainstorm new full stack project to work on:
Workout builder?

Like neetcode….

Have sections of workouts (stretching, foam rolling, warm ups, hamstrings, etc)

Let people build their own workout by adding an exercise

Workout will build in a different section

They can click that section and view the workout they built

Maybe let them choose a “layout” for posture, balance, etc

-apply to 2 jobs
