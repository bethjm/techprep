Today I am focusing on learning how to think about solving techincal interview questions

////////////////////////////////////

Q1.

things I am understanding:

1. "brute forcing it" is less effective
2. sorting the array is more effective than brute force checking it is more effective, but takes up memory space
3. I understand how a has set would be the most effective way to check for duplicates

things I am struggling to understand:

1. what the time space measurements actually mean
   solution- I will put the measurements on flascards and memorize what they are so I am more familiar with them
2. Python syntax
   solution- keep learning
3. How to do this in JavaScript
   solution- don't worry about that right now, it will be a priority in the future

Notes:

Q2.

things I am understanding:

1. using hash map to check if it's an anagram
2.

things I am struggling to understand: 0. .get and why it needds to be used in python

1. syntax, that will be a theme for a while.
2. time complexity and storage complexity

note: when I hear this I can say "ah I understand how this makes sense. I dont know how to do it on my own"

Good first step
